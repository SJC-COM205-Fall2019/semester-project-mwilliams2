<h2><strong>Our Values </strong></h2>
<p><strong>When contracting with larger, well known construction management (CM) and general contracting (GC) firms, substantial overhead and operational costs are transferred to the owner increasing the overall cost of the project. The larger construction firms subject clients to large, complicated fee structures and convoluted "mark up" entitlements making the process more difficult and more expensive than it needs to be. Greenway USA is not affiliated with any organized labor group and can therefore manage your projects with non-union or union trade craft personel. </strong></p>
